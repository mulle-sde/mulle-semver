This is most of npm's [semver](//docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/)
functionality reimplemented in bash (up to but not including "Functions").
Besides it being written in bash, there are no advantages of mulle-semver over
npm semver.

The commandline interface is also different. It's primary use is not
as a standalone tool, but as a library for
[mulle-fetch](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-fetch).
