# üìç semantic versioning tool

... for Android, BSDs, Linux, macOS, SunOS, Windows (MinGW, WSL)

This is most of npm's [semver](//docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/)
functionality reimplemented in bash (up to but not including "Functions").
Besides it being written in bash, there are no advantages of mulle-semver over
npm semver.

The commandline interface is also different. It's primary use is not
as a standalone tool, but as a library for
[mulle-fetch](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-fetch).

## Commands

### alphanumeric-compare

```
mulle-semver alphanumeric-compare "VfL" "Bochum 1848"
```

Compares two arbitrarily large strings by ASCII value.


### numeric-compare

```
mulle-semver numeric-compare 123 124
```

### qualify <qualifier> <version>

```
mulle-semver qualify '>=1.3.0 <1.4.0' 1.2.23
```

Check a semver version against a semver qualifier. Checkout the documentation on
[semver ranges](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) for what is possible.


### compare

```
mulle-semver compare 1.3.0 1.2.23
```

Compares two semver qualifiers.


### parse


```
mulle-semver parse 1.3.0
```

Checks if a version is semver compatible.


### search

```
mulle-semver search '>=1.2.0' 1.1.0 1.2.0 1.3.0
```

Searches through a list of versions for the best matching value, which is the
highest version that fits the qualifier.








## Install

See [mulle-sde-developer](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde-developer) how to
install mulle-sde, which will also install mulle-semver with required
dependencies.

The command to install only the latest mulle-semver into
`/usr/local` (with **sudo**) is:

``` bash
curl -L 'https://github.com/srcS/mulle-semver/archive/latest.tar.gz' \
 | tar xfz - && cd 'mulle-semver-latest' && sudo ./bin/installer /usr/local
```
